<p>
&nbspWe conducted legal campaigns with district legal cell authority co-operation in Kakatiya University college of law, assigns high school SR Nagar Colony and other slums target issues of domestic violence, child rights, rights to information act and women rights.
</p>
<p>
&nbspIn order to equip our targeted beneficiaries on legal issues we have arranged legal aid awareness camps in slum areas and educated the masses on certain acts like Dowry act, Child - Marriage act anti corruption at consumer act and more importantly caste act on women rights and child rights. This programme had a tremendous response from all the beneficiaries and every one participated positively. As our district legal services secretary Mr. M.A.Razak judges he always helpful to all community people. Six domestic violence cases are decided in the court of legal cell authority.
